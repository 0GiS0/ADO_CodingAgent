# Azure DevOps Automation Scripts

This directory contains automation scripts for Azure DevOps operations used by the GitHub Copilot CLI agent.

## Prerequisites

All scripts require:
- **AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT** environment variable with a valid Personal Access Token
- The PAT must have permissions for:
  - Work item tracking (read/write)
  - Code (read/write for PR operations)
  - Identity (read for user lookups)

## Scripts

### 0. get-workitem.sh

Retrieves and displays information about an Azure DevOps work item.

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/get-workitem.sh <work-item-id> [project]
```

**Parameters:**
- `work-item-id`: Work Item ID number (required)
- `project`: Project name (optional, uses System_TeamProject if not provided)

**Environment Variables:**
- `AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT`: Personal Access Token (required)
- `System_CollectionUri`: Azure DevOps organization URL (required) - e.g., `https://dev.azure.com/myorg/`
- `System_TeamProject`: Project name (used if project argument not provided)

**Examples:**
```bash
# Using environment variables (typical in Azure Pipelines)
./scripts/get-workitem.sh 412

# Specifying project explicitly (handles spaces automatically)
./scripts/get-workitem.sh 412 "GitHub Copilot CLI"

# With project name containing spaces
./scripts/get-workitem.sh 372 "My Project Name"
```

**What it displays:**
- Work Item ID, Type, Title, State
- Activity field value
- Assigned To, Created By (with email)
- Created Date
- Description (first 20 lines)
- Extracted information useful for other scripts (creator email, project name, etc.)

**Output:**
```

### 1. add-comment-to-workitem.sh

Adds a comment to an Azure DevOps work item.

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/add-comment-to-workitem.sh <organization> <project> <work-item-id> <comment-text>
```

**Parameters:**
- `organization`: Azure DevOps organization name (from System_CollectionUri)
- `project`: Project name (from System.TeamProject field)
- `work-item-id`: Work Item ID number
- `comment-text`: The comment text to add (supports HTML formatting)

**IMPORTANT - HTML Formatting:**
- Azure DevOps comments display better with HTML format, NOT Markdown
- Use `<b>` instead of `**` for bold
- Use `<i>` instead of `*` for italics
- Use `<br/>` for line breaks
- Use `<ul><li>` for lists
- Use `<a href="">` for links
- Use `<pre>` for code blocks

**Example:**
```bash
./scripts/add-comment-to-workitem.sh returngisorg "My Project" 372 "üëÄü§ñ Started working on this task"

# HTML formatted example:
./scripts/add-comment-to-workitem.sh returngisorg "My Project" 372 "‚úÖ <b>Implementation completed</b><br/><br/><b>Changes made:</b><ul><li>Feature A</li><li>Feature B</li></ul>"

# Error reporting example:
./scripts/add-comment-to-workitem.sh returngisorg "My Project" 372 "‚ùå <b>Error:</b> Failed to push branch<br/><br/><b>Details:</b> Permission denied"
```

**Output:**
- Success: "Comment added successfully. Comment ID: 12345"

### 5. create-pr-with-required-reviewer.sh

Creates an Azure DevOps Pull Request in Draft mode with a Required Reviewer in a single atomic operation.

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/create-pr-with-required-reviewer.sh <organization> <project> <repository-id> <source-branch> <target-branch> <title> <description> <reviewer-email>
```

**Parameters:**
- `organization`: Azure DevOps organization name
- `project`: Project name (will be URL-encoded by script)
- `repository-id`: Repository ID (GUID format)
- `source-branch`: Source branch name (e.g., "copilot/411")
- `target-branch`: Target branch name (e.g., "main")
- `title`: PR title (include work item reference like "AB#411: Description")
- `description`: PR description with details of changes
- `reviewer-email`: Email address of the required reviewer

**Example:**
```bash
# First get the repository ID
REPO_ID=$(az repos show --org https://dev.azure.com/returngisorg --project "My Project" --repository "My Repo" --query id -o tsv)

# Create PR with required reviewer
./scripts/create-pr-with-required-reviewer.sh returngisorg "My Project" "$REPO_ID" "copilot/411" "main" "AB#411: Add feature" "Description with details" user@example.com
```

**Output:**
- Success: "PR created successfully with Required Reviewer! PR ID: 77"
- Error: Error message with details

**What it does:**
1. Finds the reviewer's Identity ID from their email
2. Creates a Pull Request in **Draft** mode
3. Adds the reviewer as **Required** (NOT optional)
4. Automatically adds the "copilot" label to the PR
5. Verifies the reviewer was added with `isRequired: true`
6. Returns the PR ID and URL

**Notes:**
- PR is created in **Draft** mode by default
- Reviewer is set as **Required** which prevents PR completion without their approval
- The "copilot" label is automatically added
- This is an atomic operation - PR and required reviewer are added together
- Much more reliable than using `az repos pr create --reviewers` which only adds optional reviewers

---

### 6. add-required-reviewer.sh

Adds a required reviewer to an existing Azure DevOps Pull Request.

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/add-required-reviewer.sh <organization> <project> <repository-id> <pr-id> <reviewer-email>
```

**Parameters:**
- `organization`: Azure DevOps organization name
- `project`: Project name (will be URL-encoded by script)
- `repository-id`: Repository ID (GUID format)
- `pr-id`: Pull Request ID number
- `reviewer-email`: Email address of the reviewer

**Example:**
```bash
./scripts/add-required-reviewer.sh returngisorg "My Project" abc-123-def 42 user@example.com
```

**Output:**
- Success: "Required reviewer added successfully. Identity ID: <id>"
- Error: Error message with details

**How it works:**
1. Retrieves team members to find the reviewer's Identity ID from email
2. URL-encodes the project name for API compatibility
3. Makes PUT request to add reviewer as required
4. Verifies the reviewer was added with `isRequired: true`

**Notes:**
- Requires the reviewer to be a member of the project
- Sets `isRequired: true` which prevents PR completion without approval
- Uses PUT method (not PATCH) as per Azure DevOps API requirements

## Environment Variables

### AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT
Personal Access Token for authentication with Azure DevOps.

**Setting up:**
```bash
export AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT="your-pat-token-here"
```

```
